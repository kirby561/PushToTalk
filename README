-- Push To Talk --
------------------

	About
	-----
		This is a simple tool that gives you a single "Push To Talk" 
		hotkey for all of your voice applications such as the following:
			o Skype
			o Google Hangout
			o In-game voice
			o Anything with a voice-activated or always-on microphone.
			
		What does it do?
			o Unmutes all microphones when you press a configurable key.
			o Reduces main volume while the key is down.
			o Works globally, so it can run in the 
				background while a game is in the foreground, for example.

			
	Development
