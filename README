------------------

  About
  -----
    This is a simple tool that gives you a single "Push To Talk" 
    hotkey for all of your voice applications such as the following:
      o Skype
      o Google Hangout
      o In-game voice
      o Anything with a voice-activated or always-on microphone.
      
    What does it do?
      o Unmutes all microphones when you press a configurable key.
      o Reduces main volume while the key is down.
      o Works globally, so it can run in the 
      	background while a game is in the foreground, for example.
      
      
  Development
  -----------
    Push To Talk is written in C# and uses Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
    All you need for development is Visual Studio. Note that this was written using Visual Studio 2010 Express, but
		can be compiled still with the latest Visual Studio Community: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
    		
    To Build:
    	Open PushToTalk.sln
    	Press F5.
    	PushToTalk should build and run.
